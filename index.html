A.I has always captured my interest but the fact that many people doubted its success compelled me to write this article. So, I conducted a short survey with companies developing Artificial Intelligence Technology in India, to analyse the possible future that A.I could have on jobs and productivity. With the results of the survey, I wrote an article that was published on the online journal Youth Ki Awaaz.</p></div></div><div class="work w4"><div class="projectC"><h3>EduTech</h3><h6>2017</h6><p>Edutech is a non-profit organization that works for the betterment of society through online tutorials that educate people across the globe about the basics of technology in multiple languages.

For my keen interest and dedication to the project, I was appointed as the Head of Operations for the organisation in the beginning of 2017. As the Head of Operations, I aim at taking the organisation to a much greater level. By adding multilingual support to the website, I plan to make it accessible to people across the globe.</p></div><div class="cover edutech"></div></div><div class="work w5"><div class="cover xino"></div><div class="projectC"><h3>XINO - Extreme Innovation</h3><h6>2010 - Present</h6><p>In the year 2017, I was appointed as the President of the club.
